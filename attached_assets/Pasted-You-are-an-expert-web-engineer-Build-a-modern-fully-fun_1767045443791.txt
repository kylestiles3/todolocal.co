You are an expert web engineer. Build a modern, fully functional directory website in **Astro + TailwindCSS** that lists local events in Lexington, Kentucky. The site must be structured properly to push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel. Follow these requirements:

1. **Project Structure**
   - `src/pages/index.astro` → homepage
   - `src/components/EventList.astro` → component to render events
   - `src/data/events.ts` → static events array (use `EventItem` type)
   - `src/types/event.ts` → TypeScript interface for `EventItem`
   - `src/lib/events.ts` → a function `fetchCurrentEvents()` that returns `EventItem[]` (can initially return static events)

2. **EventItem type** (`src/types/event.ts`):
```ts
export interface EventItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  date: string; // ISO format
  time?: string;
  location?: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  sourceUrl: string;
  category: string; // e.g., 'this-week', 'this-weekend', 'free', 'pop-up', 'food-truck'
}
Static events (src/data/events.ts):

Include at least 3 sample events for testing (with future dates)

Export as export const events: EventItem[] = [...]

Homepage (src/pages/index.astro):

Import fetchCurrentEvents() from src/lib/events.ts

Call it with const events = await fetchCurrentEvents();

Render events using EventList.astro

Display tabs or sections: "This Week", "This Weekend", "Free Events"

EventList component (src/components/EventList.astro):

Accepts events: EventItem[] as a prop

Renders each event with title, date, location, description, link, and optional image

Uses Tailwind for clean styling

Scraper-ready structure (src/lib/events.ts):

Define fetchCurrentEvents() as async returning static events initially

Structure so that later we can add individual scrapers for:

VisitLex events

Craigslist yard sales

Church calendars

Food trucks

Farmers markets

Pop-ups, workshops, open mic nights, volunteer opportunities, HOA events

Normalize all scraped data into EventItem objects

Type safety

Use TypeScript everywhere (.ts or .astro with TS)

Avoid deprecated functions or any types

GitHub and Vercel readiness

Ensure project has package.json with necessary dependencies (astro, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, cheerio)

Include scripts: "dev": "astro dev", "build": "astro build", "preview": "astro preview"

Initialize Git (git init) and make the first commit

Provide instructions to push to a GitHub repo and then link to Vercel for deployment

Extras

Ensure responsive layout with Tailwind

Placeholder for images if event has none

Tabs or filters must work without page reload

Everything works in Codespaces/Replit/Astro dev environment

Deliverables

Fully typed Astro project ready to run

Clear separation: data, types, components, pages, lib

Clear instructions to push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel

Generate all code files fully, with proper imports, exports, and TypeScript typing. Do not skip any files. Ensure there are no syntax errors or broken imports. The project must run immediately on npm run dev.
